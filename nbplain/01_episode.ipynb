    "## Information: SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "As HPC services are remote machines, interaction is done over an encrypted communication channel called Secure Shell version 2 (SSH-2). This allows command-line access to one of the login nodes of a HPC service, from which you can run commands or use a command-line text editor to edit files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Users and system operators have a shared responsibility to ensure the security of resources. System operators monitor the system, ensure security patches are up-to-date and that the systems is configured to restrict access correctly e.g. so that users cannot see each others data/files by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users should follow best practice to mitigate the risk of accounts and access details being compromised, e.g. we all know that we must keep our passwords secret. You shouldn't make your files accessible to others unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong password describes a password that is difficult to detect by both humans and computer programs, effectively protecting data from unauthorized access. A strong password consists of at least twelve characters (and the more characters, the stronger the password) that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols  (@, !, &, ^ etc) if allowed. Passwords are typically case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase. Strong passwords also do not contain words that can be found in a dictionary or parts of the user's own name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSH key pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "As with Balena, we do not currently support authentication via key pairs. \n",
