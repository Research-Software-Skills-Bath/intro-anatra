    "# Running GPU Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CUDA?\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform that allows software to use GPUs for general-purpose processing. Many scientific applications in molecular dynamics, machine learning, and computational chemistry use CUDA to accelerate calculations that would take much longer on CPUs alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GPU Partitions on Anatra\n",
    "\n",
    "Anatra provides two GPU partitions depending on your research area:\n",
    "- **lifescigpu** - For Life Sciences users - Uses **Nvidia Hopper (H100, sm_90)** architecture\n",
    "- **chempgpu** - For Chemistry users - Uses **Nvidia Ada Lovelace (L40S, sm_89)** architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why GPU Architecture Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Different GPU models have different compute capabilities (architectures). Specifying the correct architecture ensures your code:\n",
    "- Compiles with the right optimizations for your GPU\n",
    "- Runs efficiently without compatibility issues\n",
    "- Avoids runtime errors from architecture mismatches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example GPU Job Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example script for a GPU job, which should be submitted from the `/scratch/projects/[project-code]/` storage area.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "#SBATCH --job-name=cuda-gpu-job\n",
    "#SBATCH --partition=lifescigpu   # or chempgpu for chemistry users\n",
    "#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1              # Request 1 GPU\n",
    "#SBATCH --time=00:05:00           # Set time limit\n",
    "#SBATCH --output=cuda_output.out  # Output file\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable detailed error reporting\n",
    "set -euo pipefail\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load CUDA module\n",
    "module load cuda/13.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set your input file\n",
    "INPUT_FILE=$1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if input file exists\n",
    "if [ -z \"$INPUT_FILE\" ]; then\n",
    "    echo \"Error: No input file provided.\"\n",
    "    exit 1\n",
    "fi\n",
    "\n",
    "if [ ! -f \"$INPUT_FILE\" ]; then\n",
    "    echo \"Error: Input file '$INPUT_FILE' not found.\"\n",
    "    exit 1\n",
    "fi\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compile for the appropriate GPU architecture\n",
    "# For Life Science Users (Hopper H100 - sm_90):\n",

    "\n",

    "./job_exec\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always specify the correct partition** for your research area\n",
    "2. **Match the architecture** (`-arch=sm_XX`) to your GPU partition\n",
    "3. **Request appropriate GPU resources** with `--gres=gpu:N`\n",
    "4. **Load the CUDA module** before compiling or running GPU code\n",
    "5. **Set reasonable time limits** to avoid unnecessary queuing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking Job Status\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "squeue -u $USER        # Check your running jobs\n",
    "squeue -p lifescigpu   # Check lifescigpu partition queue\n",
    "squeue -p chempgpu     # Check chempgpu partition queue\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter GPU-related issues:\n",
    "- Check that you're using the correct partition\n",
    "- Verify your architecture flag matches your partition's GPUs\n",
    "- Ensure CUDA modules are loaded correctly\n",
    "- Review your job output file for error messages"
